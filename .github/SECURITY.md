# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

Thank you for helping keep the `Wryt-AI-Grammar-Writing-Assistant-Browser-Extension` project secure. We take all security concerns seriously.

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to us immediately.  Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until we have had a chance to address it.

Please report security vulnerabilities by emailing the maintainers at [your_email@example.com] (replace with a valid email). Please include the following information:

*   **Vulnerability Type:** (e.g., Cross-Site Scripting, Information Disclosure)
*   **Affected Component:** (e.g., specific file, function, or feature)
*   **Detailed Description:**  Explain how the vulnerability can be exploited and the potential impact.
*   **Steps to Reproduce:**  Provide clear, step-by-step instructions to reproduce the vulnerability.
*   **Proof of Concept (Optional):**  Include a proof of concept (e.g., a code snippet) if possible.

We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and work to address the vulnerability as quickly as possible.  We may ask for additional information to help us understand and fix the issue.

## Supported Versions

We regularly update the `Wryt-AI-Grammar-Writing-Assistant-Browser-Extension` project. Security updates are prioritized for the latest stable version. We recommend that you keep your installation up to date.

## Security Best Practices

*   **Keep Dependencies Updated:** Regularly update all project dependencies, including libraries and frameworks, to the latest versions.
*   **Input Validation:**  Implement robust input validation to prevent common attacks like cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL injection.
*   **Output Encoding:**  Encode output to prevent malicious code from being interpreted by the browser or other systems.
*   **Secure Storage:** Store sensitive information (e.g., API keys, passwords) securely using appropriate encryption and access controls.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the codebase to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Follow the OWASP Top Ten:** Adhere to the OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) Top Ten security risks to ensure a secure application.
