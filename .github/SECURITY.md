## Security Best Practices

This project follows security best practices, including:

*   **Input Validation:** All user inputs are validated to prevent injection attacks (XSS, SQLi, etc.).
*   **Secure Coding Practices:**  We adhere to secure coding principles, such as the principle of least privilege.
*   **Dependency Management:** We regularly update our dependencies to address known vulnerabilities.  SBOMs (Software Bill of Materials) are generated for all builds.
*   **Encryption:** Sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** We conduct regular security audits and penetration testing.

## Security Tools and Processes

*   **Linters:** We use a linter (Biome) to automatically check code for security vulnerabilities.
*   **Dependency Scanning:**  We use automated tools to scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities as part of our CI/CD pipeline.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline:** Automated build and test pipelines are used to catch security issues early.
