# Contributing to Wryt

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Wryt! We welcome contributions from everyone.

## Code of Conduct

Please review and adhere to our [Code of Conduct](.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). We are committed to providing a welcoming and harassment-free environment.

## How to Contribute

There are many ways to contribute:

*   **Reporting bugs:** If you find a bug, please [open an issue](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md) with a clear description of the problem, steps to reproduce it, and any relevant information about your environment (browser, operating system, etc.).
*   **Suggesting enhancements:** Have an idea for a new feature or improvement? [Open an issue](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md) to discuss it with the community.
*   **Submitting pull requests:** If you're a developer, you can contribute code directly. Please follow these steps:

    1.  **Fork the repository:** Click the "Fork" button on the top right of the repository page.
    2.  **Clone the repository:** `git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Wryt-AI-Writing-and-Grammar-Checker-Browser-Extension.git`
    3.  **Create a branch:** `git checkout -b <your-branch-name>` (e.g., `git checkout -b fix-grammar-issue`)
    4.  **Make your changes:** Implement your bug fix, feature, or improvement.
    5.  **Test your changes:** Ensure that your changes do not introduce any regressions and that all existing tests pass. Add new tests if necessary.
    6.  **Commit your changes:** Use descriptive commit messages following the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format (e.g., `feat: add new feature`, `fix: correct grammar`).
    7.  **Push your changes:** `git push origin <your-branch-name>`
    8.  **Create a pull request:** Go to the original repository and click "Compare & pull request." Describe your changes clearly and concisely.

## Development Setup

To set up your development environment:

1.  **Install dependencies:**  Follow the instructions in the `README.md` to set up your environment.
2.  **Run the development server:** Use the appropriate command from the `README.md` to start the development server. This typically involves `npm run dev` or a similar command.

## Code Style

*   **Follow the project's coding style:** We use [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for linting and formatting. Ensure your code passes all checks before submitting a pull request.
*   **Write clear and concise code:** Follow the [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) principles and other best practices.
*   **Write meaningful comments:** Use comments sparingly, focusing on "why" rather than "what". Code should be self-documenting.

## Pull Request Guidelines

*   **Descriptive title and description:** Clearly explain the purpose of your pull request and what changes it makes.
*   **Small, focused pull requests:** Make sure your pull request addresses a single issue or feature. This makes it easier to review and merge.
*   **Test your changes:** Include tests for any new functionality or bug fixes.
*   **Update documentation:** If your changes affect the user interface or any other part of the project, update the documentation.
*   **Review your code:** Before submitting your pull request, review your code to make sure it is clean, well-formatted, and follows the project's coding style.
