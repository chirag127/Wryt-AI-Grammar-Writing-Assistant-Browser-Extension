# This workflow is triggered on push events to the main branch and on pull requests.
# It automates the build, test, and linting process for the project.

    steps:
      # Step 1: Check out the repository code.
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Set up Node.js environment.
      # Use the latest LTS version of Node.js.

        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'

      # Step 3: Install dependencies using npm.
      # This step caches dependencies to speed up subsequent runs.
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      # Step 4: Lint and format code using Biome.
      # This step ensures code quality and consistency.
      - name: Lint and format with Biome
        run: npx @biomejs/biome lint --apply-unsafe && npx @biomejs/biome format --apply-unsafe

      # Step 5: Build the project using Vite.
      # This step compiles the TypeScript and React code.
      - name: Build project with Vite
        run: npm run build

      # Step 6: Run unit tests using Vitest.
      # This step verifies the correctness of individual code components.
      - name: Run Vitest
        run: npm run test:unit

      # Step 7: Run E2E tests using Playwright.
      # This step tests the application's end-to-end functionality in a browser environment.
      # This step requires a browser to be installed.
      - name: Install Playwright Browsers
        run: npx playwright install

      # Step 8: (Optional) Upload coverage reports (if configured).

      #   with:
      #     token: ${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }}

      # Step 9: Upload build artifacts (e.g., extension files).
      # This step archives the build output for later deployment or inspection.
